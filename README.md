# impact-on-non-wage-benefits
This is a completed study from my undergraduate Senior project.
Analytical tools used: STATA and Python
Data: Labor Force Survey Pakistan

The project is as follows:
"This paper aims to discover whether a rise in the minimum wage is linked to a decrease in
non-wage benefits and working conditions for employees in the daily wage formal work sector of
Punjab and Sindh. We use a difference-in-differences methodology on spatial and industrial variation
based on changes in trade union and minimum wage laws to test whether this link is more robust in
one province or another. We find that increases in the minimum wage led to an overall decrease in
the monthly in-kind payments and non-wage benefits to workers throughout. We also found that
industries which were more compliant with labor laws were generally more likely to reduce employee
benefits as a response to an increase in minimum wage owing to the fact that compliant industries
were more likely to comply with an increase and thus reduced the non-wage benefits to cover for the
increased payroll expense of higher salaries. Finally, we also found that despite higher labor union
participation, Sindh saw a more significant decrease in non-wage benefits in response to a higher
minimum wage than Punjab."
